	<h1>jQuery</h1>
	<!-- A library is simply a collection of functions and code that someone has written to make a set of tasks easier in a specific programming language 

	By including the jQuery library you can call upon the functions in your code

	you can includ the library by linking it in the head section to a saved file downloaded from jquery.com or linked directly to the url address.

	You can call functions in an arbitrary <script> block after your library has been
    loaded with a script tag:
	"function() {}" 

	You can determine if the page is using jQuery by typing 'jQuery' in the console of your browser. You can also type '$'. 

	The Document Object Model (DOM)
	The DOM is a standard for interacting with and representing objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML
	jQuery makes it incredibly easy to select elements in the DOM, which include practically any HTML tag or element

	jQuery can be used to select elements using a similar syntax to CSS
	The format for selecting elements is: $("<element name, class, id, or XPath>")
		ex. $("body")

	The $(document).ready() snippet
	This snippet ensures that your code doesn't run until your document ﬁres a ready event
	The ready event ﬁres when all of the page's DOM elements are loaded, even if multimedia elements aren't fully loaded
	By encapsulating all of our jQuery code to only run when the document is ready, the elements you're selecting will deﬁnitely be on the page when you access them

	A callback is an anonymous function supplied to another function to be run when that function is done running
	to use this feature define two funcrtions and then call upon them like so: someRunner(someOtherFunction);

	Here are some examples:

	-->

	<div class="element1"></div>
	<div class="element2"></div>
	<div class="element3"></div>
	<div class="element4">Click Here to see the secret</div>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		$(document).ready(function(){
			$(".element1").fadeOut(4000);

			$(".element2").slideUp(3000);

			var animateBlock = function(){   
				$(".element3").animate( {
					opacity: .5} 
					) 
			}; 

				$(".element3").show(animateBlock);

			$(".element4").click(
				function(){     
					alert('Ha ha! Made you look! =P');   
				} 
				);
		}); 
	</script>
